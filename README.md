## Overview and Origin

Imagine watching Anderson Cooper on CNN interviewing a lady in India who has set up a facebook profile for the first time and now she feels like she truly exists outside of her own head. A sense of belonging to the world and not just herself. Well, that formation of identity sparked the idea of Trulioo.  Founders Stephen Ufford and Tanis Jorge had a mission to bring that sense of belonging to others over the world on a global platform. 

Formed in 2011 Vancouver, BC, Trulioo takes on the mission to provide electronic identity verification. We will explore in further details their lines of business and the various programs used to verify online identity.  Trulioo has received $96.6 million in funding thus far and their top investors are Goldman Sachs, American Express and Citi Ventures to name a few.

## Business Activities:

Identity verification stems into the realm of Know Your Client (KYC), Anti Money Laundering (AML) and fraud prevention. The more a company expands the more risk is increased. Looking back at the history of money, marketplace and the financial systems most transactions were completed in person with physical cash and physical documents. Through the Global Gateway service Trulioo allows consumers and businesses to transact safely and securely. Global Gateway API system is embedded with 400+ reliable databases in 195+ countries. Those databases range from Credit Bureaus, Banks, Utility Companies,  Business Registers, Mobile Networks, Biometrics, Government, the list goes on! 


  

Global Gateway solutions of Identity Verification, ID Document Verification, Business Verification, Embed ID and AML Watchlist Screening allows companies to achieve compliance, prevent fraud, build trust and ensure safety of their clients. Trulioo’s two main focus is to assist individuals and companies with the online onboarding identity verification and increasing the global scale of businesses.


Trulioo has been able to verify 5 billion people and they continue to reach the 7.5 billion goal to be a part of the safe space digital economy. Trulioo's competitive advantage is the borders they have been able to enter virtually, enabling them to provide their solutions to over 60 countries. 
Some smaller firms may have the capacity to do a similar service of identity verification but they are limited to smaller borders. That competitive edge draws big investors such as Goldman Sachs as previously mentioned.


## Landscape:

Trulioo is a part of the Regtech domain also known as regulation technology. Regulations and policies will never go away. Regtech companies offer businesses systems to automate, track, and enhance compliance within their infrastructure. Regtech uses cloud computing and big data to monitor and solve issues in the digital economy. Companies like Trulioo collaborate with financial institutions and government bodies to gather information to implement programs to adhere to policies and protect users.


From the 2008 financial crisis policies have tightened even more in the financial sector. The subprime mortgage crisis was something the world had never experienced before and don’t want to be in again. Prevention is key and that’s where regtech firms play a huge role in the Fintech sector. Regtech solutions help to solve compliance and regulatory issues of business. Regulations and policies will always be in place. Why not automate them to reduce risk and to focus on the sale and revenue to grow your company.  

Some great companies in the regtech field are IdentityMind, SuadeLabs and Silverfinch. IdentityMind is similar to Trulioo in identity verification, they aim to reduce fraud at the onboarding stage by 95% but they only operate in the United States. SuadeLabs focuses on helping banks complete regulatory reports. Silverfinch assists asset managers in the European Union to meet Solvency II requirements.



## Results

Trulioo was awarded with the “Best Identity Verification and Authentication Solution” at the 2016 CNP awards. Amazon, Paypal, Square and WorldRemit are among Trulioo’s cliente. Those names speak volumes, literally with the amount of customers they service and they trust Trulioo to authenticate and protect their customers from fraud and identity risk so they continue to do business in ease. 




Risk has value which could be of positive or negative impact to a corporation. There was a reported 10.4 billion in fines and penalties to financial institutions globally related to KYC, AML and data privacy. I know those numbers are on a global scale but if financial institutions do not have robust systems in place to protect their clients money will continue to come out of their bottom line. As we push forward in the online ecosystem, the risk of KYC and AML will continue to rise. Trulioo measures success in the amount of identity verfiered, previous at the 4 billion mark now at 5 and reaching to verify the 7.5 billion world population. With increased global identification, more individuals on their platform the more businesses they can assist. Global identity for all and feeling to belong securely.

What truly makes Trulioo unique is their one system API. One API has brought the company this far into global regions. 

## Recommendations

With the large database of information I think Trulioo has the ability to create an Online ID which will be its own source of verification. Online ID can be a one stop shop for users. All of their clients' identity documents formed into one number like a SIN. For example you are purchasing a flight on the internet and is ask to fill out your information ( name, date of birth, passport etc.) just by interesting your Online ID number all of that information appears. 

Online ID would attract more users to the platform and therefore allowing Trulioo to be closer to their goal of verifying the world.
